Welcome to appengine-ndb-experiment.

In this project I am going to develop a new, experimental datastore
API for the Google App Engine Python runtime. I am doing this as a
Google employee but using an open source development style as I
believe this project will benefit from early user feedback.

Eventually, when the project is sufficiently mature, the code will
(hopefully) become a standard component of the App Engine Python SDK
and the Python runtime. Until then, however, the way to use this code
is to check it out from the repository and copy it into your
application.

Until the code is integrated into the SDK and runtime, I am not going
to worry about backwards compatibility between versions of this
experimental code. You are not required to check out the trunk,
however I do not plan to fix bugs in older branches.
